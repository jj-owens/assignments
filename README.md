Learning Repo 
====================

This is the main README file for all of my learning projects.
Each of the directories in this directory represents a coding challenge (daily, short practices), 
exercise (completed immediately after learning a new topic), 
or a project (used to test my ability in given areas of development) that I've worked on. 
Each of these assignments has a README file that explains the work as well as a summary of what 
I learned by completing it.
