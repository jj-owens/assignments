Here I created a website that had to include the video game char Mario. The goal of the site was to make a page where the 
clients of mario could calculate how much it would cost them for mario to remove baddies from their world(level). 
In this project I went a bit above and beyond, made my own video background and used spyscroll to acheive a modern site look.
I tried to let this project stand apart from my classmates.
