Here I created a text based RPG game using readLineSync. This was a fairly large project and took several hours. There were
many challenges associated with completing this project including but not limited to: creating a combat system, creating a 
health system, creating conditions for win or loss, creation of functions and callback functions, creation of randomized
enemies with randomized health and attack points, creation of an inventory system, storyline and premise creation.
This project was demo'd in front of the whole class.
