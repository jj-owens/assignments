Projects  
====================

Projects are specifically geared towards testing my ability to demonstrate an understand a collection of topics. Projects represent a culmination both of topics that have been recently learned as well as those that have already been tested in the past. As time progresses, I will make projects more intense, as they naturally build off of everything I've learned up to the point of the project.

In the beginning, they've typically been done in 1 or 2 days. Presently, they can take up to a week or more.
