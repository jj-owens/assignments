This project was to create a site which would enable people to post scores of their video game acheivements to a website. 
The goal was to use forms and the form data to create a dynamic table. Local storage was initially used and acheived, however 
when trying to make the table sortable, local storage was broken.

-1/31/2017: still need to figure out how to make table sorting work with local storage.
