The purpose of the business time project was to creat a full static website with multiple pages. Requirements were to 
have lots of images, and stylized elements moving from one page to the next. We focused on good page flow, creation of 
proper contextual areas, and links. Bootstrap was used, and also had to find images to use. All text content created by me.
