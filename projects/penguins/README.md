Here I created an app which was designed to showcase my ability to form logic based functions and callback functions to 
a proficient degree. The point of this app is that there are two sides, penguins and communists. When running the app, the
program choses a random side to go first, and then each side takes turns launching nukes and inflicting random damage on the 
other until one population reaches zero, which ends the program.
